## Dependences

We recommend the version **_v18.9.0_** of **_node_** and the **_pnpm_** packager manager to execute the code. Before running the commands to start the API or the interface, run the command **_pnpm install_** inside the directories **_server_** and **_web_** to install the necessary dependences.

## To run the API

Use the command: **_pnpm run dev_** inside the **_server_** directory.

## To run the UI
Use the command **_pnpm run build_** to build the web site, then use the command **_pnpm start_** to start the app. both commands should be executed inside the **_web_** directory.
