# A Framework to support empirical experimentation on Cognitive Biases in Search as Learning

This repository contains the source code for the Xper4SAL. The Xper4SAL is the framework capable of instantiating experimentation on Cognitive Biases in Search as Learning.

The `/server` folder contains the source code of the backend developed in NestJS. The `/web` folder contains the frontend developed in ReactJS.

## Dependences

We recommend the version **_v18.9.0_** of **_node_** and the **_pnpm_** packager manager to execute the code. Before running the commands to start the API or the interface, run the command **_pnpm install_** inside the directories **_server_** and **_web_** to install the necessary dependences.

## To run the API

Use the command: **_pnpm start_** inside the **_server_** directory.

## To run the UI
Use the command **_pnpm run build_** to build the web site, then use the command **_pnpm start_** to start the app. both commands should be executed inside the **_web_** directory.
